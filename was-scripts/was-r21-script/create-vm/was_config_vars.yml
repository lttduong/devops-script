# Encryption key password, used to encrypt sensitive internal data (including data stored in the database).
# - If this field is empty: a new password is generated during installation. NOTE: in this case, configuration

# - If this field is populated: the given password is used to calculate a deterministic encryption key.
# Notes for Customers:
# - Customers should not in general set this value, instead preferring a generated value
#   (thus ensuring the password is always kept secret).
# - If this value is set, then this file should itself be encrypted or moved to a secure area after installation
