  ## - none (or empty) :: No certificates
  ## - cmgr            :: Automatically generated certificates
  ## - <secret>        :: Manually supplied certificates in the specified <secret>
  ## Note: These interfaces are valid only when use_tls is true.
  ##
  ## 1. No certificates
  ##    P/V:   certificates.secret: none (or empty)
  ##    Descr: No certificates are configured and only TLS (aka SSL) ciphers will be used.
  ##
  ## 2. Manually supplied certificates
  ##    P/V:   certificates.secret: <secret>
  ##    Descr: The <secret> value is a kubectl secret object that contains six files as
  ##           specified by the following 6 parameters.
  ##           - client_ca_cert
  ##           - server_ca_cert

  ##           - client_key
  ##           - server_cert

  ##    Notes:
  ##      - The secret resource containing all the certificate files must be pre-populated
  ##        before CMDB deployment.
  ##      - Certificates are stored in the /etc/my.cnf.d/ssl directory.
  ##
  ## 3. Automatically generated certificates
  ##    P/V:   certificates.secret: cmgr
  ##    Descr: This interface creates two kubectl secret objects with the following names:
  ##           - {{cmdb.fullname}}-client-cert
  ##           - {{cmdb.fullname}}-server-cert
  ##           and will automatically generate the 6 files as specified by the (above mentioned) 6 parameters.

cbur:
  enabled: true
  ## Exposes jobhookenable to control BrPolicy behaviour for galera
  ## When enabled, no action in postRestoreCmd and postrestore job hook for
  ## helm restore should run. When disabled, postRestoreCmd is executed and
  ## subsequent out-of-band helm heal is required.
  ## Interim solution for CSFS-12078, set to disabled in ComPaas.
  jobhookenable: true
  ## Exposes legacy NCMS Helm plugin hooks to override the BrHook mechanism added to
  #  ## BCMT in 20.03 (CSFID-2617).
  legacyHooks: false
  ## defines the backup storage options, i.e. local, NetBackup, S3, Avamar.
  backendMode: local
  ## specifies if the backup scheduling cron job should be auto-scheduled
  autoEnableCron: false
  ## allows user to schedule backups
  cronSpec: "0 0 * * *"
  ## should backups be encrypted?
  dataEncryption: true
  ## defines how many backup copies should be saved
  maxiCopy : 5
  ## Interface to BrPolicy to ignore file changes during building tarball for target app's volumes.
