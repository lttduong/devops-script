# Values for umbrella charts need to be redefined and provided for upgrade as helm omits subcharts values
# during upgrade operation and use defaults instead (https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/2948).
# After switch to helm3 it should work properly.
## Start of subcharts values
cmdb:
  enabled: false
## End of subcharts values
