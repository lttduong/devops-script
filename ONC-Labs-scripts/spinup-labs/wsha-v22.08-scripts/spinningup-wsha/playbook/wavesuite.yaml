# Proxy Information.
########################################################################################################################

# Configures the WaveSuite services to use the following proxy for outgoing HTTP and HTTPS requests respectively.
# If the proxy is not configured then certain services (such as weather service) may be unavailable.
#
# The configured value should always include the protocol (http:// or https://) and may include the the port if required.
# For example, "http://my-internal-insecure-proxy.example.com:8080" or "https://my-internal-secure-proxy.example.com"
#
# Proxy servers which require authentication are not supported.
# By default no proxy servers will be used.
http_proxy_server:
https_proxy_server:

# When one or both of the above proxy servers are configured, the specified hosts will be excluded from proxy resolution.
#
# This should not include any protocols or ports but can include multiple hosts by using a comma separated list.
# For example, "my-internal-host,my-internal-tile-server,my-internal-router"
#
# The internal services and all installation hosts will be automatically excluded from proxy resolution.
no_proxy:

# The externally-facing port to access the WaveSuite application.
#
# The application will be reachable at https://<host>:<wavesuite_portal_port>/wavesuite/ha/ui after the installation has
# completed.
#
# The default value for this port is 8443.
wavesuite_portal_port: "8443"


########################################################################################################################
# SSL Configuration
########################################################################################################################
# The WaveSuite installer will generate an external SSL certificate.
#
# The external certificate will be generated using an internal Nokia root CA unless a user-provided certificate is
# specified via the ssl_external_certificate_path, ssl_external_certificate_key_path and ssl_key_password_path variables.
#
# The external certificate will be generated with a Subject set from the ssl_certificate_* parameters below, and an
# expiry set from the ssl_certificate_expiry_length parameter below.
#
# The Common Name (CN) and Subject Alternative Names (SAN) list of the generated external SSL certificate will be the
# client facing IP(s) specified by the client_zone parameter.

# If 'ca_certificates_path' is specified, then the installer will import any CA certificates located at the specified
# absolute path into the WaveSuite trust store. The root base names of the CA files will be used as certificate aliases
# in the trust store. Therefore, the CA certificate root base names must be unique.
#
# By default, no additional CA certificates will be imported.
ca_certificates_path: 

# The 2-letter country code that will be added to the Subject Name of the installer-generated certificate.
#
# The default country name will be set to 'CA' (Canada).
ssl_certificate_country_name: "CA"

# The installer-generated certificate will be valid for the provided number of days.
#
# The default expiry length (in days) is set to '730'.
ssl_certificate_expiry_length: 730

# The city/locality name that will be added to the Subject Name of the installer-generated certificate.
#
# The default locality name will be set to 'Ottawa'.
ssl_certificate_locality_name: "Ottawa"

# The organization name that will be added to the Subject Name of the installer-generated certificate.
#
# The default organization name will be set to 'Nokia'.
ssl_certificate_organization_name: "Nokia"

# The organizational unit name that will be added to the Subject Name of the installer-generated certificate.
#
# The default organizational unit name will be set to 'WaveSuite'.
ssl_certificate_organizational_unit_name: "WaveSuite"

# The state name that will be added to the Subject Name of the installer-generated certificate.
#
# The default state name will be set to 'Ontario'.
ssl_certificate_state_name: "Ontario"

# SSL parameter to ignore the user-provided certificate warning-level validation issues.
# Valid values are "true" or "false".
#
# By default, this value is true.
ssl_external_certificate_ignore_warnings:

# 'ssl_external_certificate_path' is the absolute path to a file containing a user-provided external public certificate. This
# MUST be provided in the PEM format.
#
#  In a standalone setup, this value represents a single absolute path to the external public certificate to be used.
#
#  In a redundant setup, this value is dictionary consisting of all target installation hosts defined in
#  'wavesuite_target_installation_hosts' each with the value of the absolute path to the user-provided external public
#  certificate file for that host.
#
#  Examples:
#  --------
#    standalone setup
#    --------------------------------------------------------------
#    ssl_external_certificate_path: /opt/WaveSuite_Host.crt
#
#    redundant setup
#    --------------------------------------------------------------
#    ssl_external_certificate_path:
#       target_host_1:
#           - /opt/WaveSuite_Host_A.crt
#       target_host_2:
#           - /opt/WaveSuite_Host_B.crt
#
# If this value is left blank the installer will generate a self-signed external public SSL certificate.
ssl_external_certificate_path:

# `ssl_external_certificate_key_path` is the absolute path to a file containing the private key for the certificate provided
# through `ssl_external_certificate_path`. This MUST be provided in the PEM format.
#
# In a standalone setup this will refer to a single file by an absolute path
#
# In a redundant setup, this value is a dictionary associating the absolute path to the private key file to each host
#
#  Examples:
#  --------
#    standalone setup
#    --------------------------------------------------------------
#    ssl_external_certificate_path: /opt/WaveSuite_Host.key
#
#    redundant setup
#    --------------------------------------------------------------
#    ssl_external_certificate_path:
#       target_host_1:
#           - /opt/WaveSuite_Host_A.key
#       target_host_2:
#           - /opt/WaveSuite_Host_B.key
#
# If this value is left blank the installer will generate an external private SSL key.

# If the system is expected to be reachable through an external address not configured by the system (i.e., via a proxy
# that is sitting in front of the WaveSuite system), then the following property must be set. The external access
# address is expected to be either a FQDN, or IPv4:PORT pair.
#
# The external access address will be configured as the Common Name on the installer-generated SSL certificate. All
# authentication requests will be redirected via the configured external access address.
#
# The external access address is assumed to be configured with HTTPS. The address configured should not be prepended
# with 'https://'.
#
#  Examples:
#  --------
#    external_access_address: "some-fqdn.domain.com"

# Traffic Zone Addresses
########################################################################################################################
# Traffic zones define which IP address an application should bind its port to.
#
# Each zone is intended to be populated with key/value pairs.
#   - The keys must be a valid host key from the wavesuite_target_installations_hosts configuration.
#
#   - The values must be a list of ip addresses from a valid network interface on the designated target installation
#     host. The exception to this rule is if the "-" character is provided. Then, the installer will not bind any ports
#     from services belonging to that zone when installing on the corresponding target installation host.
#
# Traffic zones can be added and removed from this file as needed. This means that the client_zone, internal_zone,
# and localhost_zone can be renamed or removed as desired. The client, internal, and localhost zones will be used as the
# default configuration if the installer has not been configured.
#
# All zone IP addresses will show up in the SAN of the generated SSL certificate.
#
# Example:
# --------
#   sftp_zone:
#       target_host_1:
#           - 10.10.10.1
#
#   sftp_zone:
#       target_host_1:
#           - 10.10.10.1
#
# In the above example, we are configuring the zones for the hosts from the wavesuite_target_installation_hosts example.
#
# Services configured to use the client zone will bind their ports to:
#   - Both 10.10.10.1 and 10.10.10.2 when installed on host 10.255.1.1,
#   - 10.200.1.1 when installed on host test-fqdn.domain.com,
#   - and 10.100.1.1 when installed on host 10.0.0.1.
#
# Services configured to use the internal zone will not bind their ports to any IP address on either target installation
# host.
########################################################################################################################

# The client_zone provides the user-facing IPs of the target host. The client_zone is expected to only have a single IP
# address provided per target host, but multiple IP addresses are supported.
#
# The client zone IP address will show up in the CN and SAN of the generated external SSL certificate. If multiple IP
# addresses are provided, then the first IP address will show up in the CN and all IP addresses will show up in the SAN
# of the generated external SSL certificate. If a certificate is provided by ssl_pubic_certificate_path, that
# certificate will be validated against the client_zone IP address(es).
#
# By default, the installer will map the 'target_host' host key to the IP of the default route for the client zone.
client_zone:

# The installer will bind the database's port (3306) to the IP address provided. Defaults to '127.0.0.1'.
database_zone:

# The internal zone is intended to contain services that should be available on an internal network interface.
#
# By default, the installer will map the 'target_host' host key to the IP of the default route for the internal zone.
internal_zone:

# The localhost zone is intended to contain services that should be hidden from user interaction, but should still
# have their ports available on the host system.
#
# By default, the installer will map the 'target_host' host key to '127.0.0.1' for the localhost zone.
localhost_zone:

# If sftp_zone is specified, then the given IP address will be used to expose the sFTP port associated to the data
# acquisition adapter to this specific interface.  If this variable is left unset then the sFTP port will not be exposed
# to any interface and the sFTP service will not be enabled.

# Service Deployment Configuration
########################################################################################################################
# This section maps services to the zones in which they will be deployed. Each service represents an application that
# will be deployed as part of the installation process.
